# Introduction

In this series of hands-on lessons, you will learn the basics of cloud computing by installing and hosting an eCommerce site in the cloud.

## What is cloud computing

Cloud computing allows you to use resources provided by a **cloud service provider** instead of purchasing your own hardware and software. 

You 'rent' these  cloud services on a monthly basis and only pay for what you use. This avoids the complexity and cost of purchasing and maintaining your own hardware and software.

With cloud computing, you donâ€™t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.
